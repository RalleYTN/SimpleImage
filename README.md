# Description
SimpleImage is a library that was written to simplify image processing in Java.
Complex processing can be done in a single line of code and is highly readable and maintainable.
The library wasn't optimized for game development! It's meant for basic GUI applications.
The library supports Java 8 and the JavaFX framework. If support for JavaFX is *not* needed, you simply shouldn't use the `simple-image-fx_vX.X.X.jar`.

## Features
- Reading/Writing images
- JavaFX support
- Converting SimpleImage instances to BufferedImage instances
- Fast image filtering
- Pre-coded image filters
- Mirroring images on both axis
